            <h3>Blog Post #1 Title 1/4/2018</h3>

            <p>
           Stating on my 8th birthday with my twin brother, my dad invited his new friends from Texas to join us. Btw, for thoes who don't know me, we had moved to Texas just three months before that. During that party, my dads friends were out shooting in the back, so I went out with my dad and started the process of learning how to shoot both safely and accurately. Soon after that my dad went looking for a shooting place, and found a place called "Texas Multi-Gun". Then my dad decided to test us and see who, of all my sibling and I, would get to go with him to the gun range. He first, with the help of my brothers and I, built a shooting course in the forest where we were tested. The rules were simple, be safe and get the most points. Whoever got the most points went with my dad to Texas Muti-Gun.</p>
